## Dadegan
Dadegan is a simple package which contains a handful of useful Persian datasets.

### Install
You can install this package by running the following code in your R console:
`remotes::install_github('mcnakhaee/dadegan')`

### Usage

here are a few large datasets in this package so I strongly recommend that you do not load the package with the `library()` command but rather use something like this to access to the dataset that you might need:

`dadegan::divar`
