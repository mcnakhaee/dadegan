\details{
The original data included cases where a country was absent
or was not yet a member. In this dataset these were filtered out to
include only votes of Yes, Abstain, and No.

Country name can be converted to other unique country identifiers
(such as 2-character or 3-character ISO codes) using the
\link[countrycode]{countrycode} function from the countrycode
package.

\examples{

library(dplyr)

# percentage yes by country
by_country <- un_votes \%>\%
  group_by(country) \%>\%
  summarize(votes = n(),
            percent_yes = mean(vote == 1))

arrange(by_country, percent_yes)
arrange(by_country, desc(percent_yes))

# combine with per-vote information
un_votes \%>\%
  inner_join(un_roll_calls, by = "rcid")

# combine with issue
votes_issues <- un_votes \%>\%
  inner_join(un_roll_call_issues, by = "rcid")

# for example, which countries voted yes least often on Colonialism
votes_issues \%>\%
  filter(issue == "Colonialism") \%>\%
  group_by(country) \%>\%
  summarize(percent_yes = mean(vote == 1)) \%>\%
  arrange(percent_yes)
